# Welcome to my website !

As you can see, the website is under construction.
Below, I post some videos that I found interesting.

1. *Advice to young scientists* - By EO Wilson

I watched this at a time when I was quite confused about which research direction to pursue. I can't say it resolved my confusion. But it definitely gave me some direction, something to think about and figure out for myself.

2. *Isolation is the dream-killer, not your attitude* - By Barbara Sher

I watched this at around the same time as the *Advice to young scientists* video. Take away from this video:
 
  1. Write down, what you want. *Be very precise*
  2. List down, what are the obstacles preventing you from achieving what you want. *Again, be very specific* and don't worry if the obstacles seem **stupid** to you.
  3. In the video, there was a gathering of diverse people who (after a person said out loud, the above two points) typically came up with some solution to the problem. But I think, for an individual it is important to write to the person, who you believe is the best person, asking for help/suggestion/advice. Tell them in your email why you believe they will be able to help you out.
